<h1>{$servicename} Terms and Conditions</h1>





<h2>1. Domain Name Registration Agreement</h2>
This {$servicename} Domain Name Registration Agreement ("Agreement") is
by and between {$servicename} and You, Your heirs, agents, successors
and assigns ("You"), and is made effective as of the date of electronic
execution. This Agreement sets forth the terms and conditions of Your
use of {$servicename}'s Domain Name Registration and represents the
entire agreement between You and {$servicename}. By participating in
this transaction, You acknowledge that You have read, understand and
agree to be bound by all the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
including our dispute policy and the ICANN Transfer Dispute Resolution
Policy along with any new, different or additional terms, conditions or
policies, including the Universal Terms of Service which {$servicename}
may establish from time to time. Such Agreements may be found here. <br>
<br>
In addition to transactions entered into by You on Your behalf, You also
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement for transactions
entered into on Your behalf by anyone acting as Your Agent, and
transactions entered into by anyone who uses the account You've
established with {$servicename}, whether or not the transactions were in
Your behalf. You acknowledge that {$servicename}'s acceptance of any
application made by You for services provided by {$servicename} will
take place at the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers
("ICANN") accredited registrar's offices located in Scottsdale, Arizona,
USA. <br>
<br>
You acknowledge that {$servicename} is a registrar bound by an agreement
between {$servicename} and ICANN. You agree that {$servicename} may
modify this agreement in order to comply with applicable law and the
terms and conditions set forth by the ICANN and/or the Registry
Administrator chosen by ICANN, as well as any registration rules or
policies that may be published from time to time by {$servicename} . <br>
<br>
<br>

<h3>Domain registration and billing proccess</h3>
<strong>
After You either make a payment at the end of domain registration wizard or pay the corresponding invoice from Registrant CP,
you must log in to Your Registrant CP and complete registration of the domain.
Since the domain remains available for registration to anyone until You complete registration,
it can be registered by another registrant in the time span between the payment and registration completion.
You are responsible to a potential failure of domain registration caused by this delay.
In this case, no funds will be returned to you automatically. You must open a dispute to get your funds returned to you.
To avoid such issues, please complete domain registration as soon as possible, right after the payment is made.</strong>

<br>
<h3>1.1. fees</h3> In consideration for the services and products ("service")
purchased by You and provided to You by {$servicename}, You agree to pay
{$servicename} at the time service is provided. Payment is to be made by paying corresponding invoice using on of the available online payment methods. 
You understand
that ICANN requires {$servicename} to collect a small registration fee
when you purchase your domain name registration. You agree to pay such
fees. Payments are non-refundable. If for any reason {$servicename} is
unable to charge Your Payment Method for the full amount owed
{$servicename} for the service provided, or if {$servicename} is charged
a penalty for any fee it previously charged to your Payment Method, You
agree that {$servicename} may pursue all available remedies in order to
obtain payment. You agree that among the remedies {$servicename} may
pursue in order to effect payment, shall include but will not be limited
to, immediate cancellation without notice to You of any domain names
registered or renewed on Your behalf. {$servicename} reserves the right
to charge a reasonable service fee for administrative tasks outside the
scope of its regular services. These include, but are not limited to,
customer service issues that cannot be handled over email but require
personal service, and disputes that require legal services. These
charges will be billed to the Payment Method we have on file for You.
You may change your Payment Method at any time by logging into Your
<a fref='/client'>Registrant CP</a>. <br>
<br>
Domain Name Renewals<br>
<br>
When You register a domain name, You have the option to elect that the
domain name be automatically renewed upon reaching the expiration date.
Automatic renewal is the default setting, which You must deactivate if
You do not want Your domain name(s) to be automatically renewed. Unless
You disable the automatic renewal option, {$servicename} will
automatically renew, for a period equivalent to the length of your
original registration, any domain name that is up for renewal and will
take payment from the Payment Method You have on file with
{$servicename}, at {$servicename}'s then current rates. Thus, if you
have chosen to register your domain name for one year, {$servicename}
will automatically renew it for one year. If you have chosen to register
your domain name for two years, {$servicename} will automatically renew
it for two years, and so on. Domain name renewals will be non
refundable. If for any reason {$servicename} is not able to take the
payment from the Payment Method You have on file, and You fail to
respond to our notices, Your domain name registration will expire. It is
Your responsibility to keep Your Payment Method information current,
which includes the expiration date if you are using a credit card. If
You do not elect that the domain name be automatically renewed, You have
the responsibility of logging into Your <a fref='/client'>Registrant CP</a> for that domain
name and manually implementing the renewal by the expiration date
(should You in fact want the domain name to be renewed). In this case,
if You fail to manually implement the renewal in a timely fashion the
domain name will be cancelled and You will no longer have use of that
name. You agree that {$servicename} will not be responsible for
cancelled domain names that You fail to renew, either automatically or
manually. In any case, if You fail to renew Your domain name in a timely
fashion, additional charges may apply. If You signed up for domain
masking, domain forwarding, or any other similar service, with Your
domain registration, these services may be automatically renewed when
Your domain registration is up for renewal, and You may incur an
additional renewal fee unless You cancel in advance. <br>
<br>
If you fail to renew your domain name, you agree that {$servicename}
may, at its sole discretion, renew your expired domain name on your
behalf. If {$servicename} decides to renew your expired domain name on
your behalf you will have a Renewal Grace Period during which you may
reimburse {$servicename} for the renewal and keep your domain name. The
Renewal Grace Period is currently 12 days but subject to change under
the terms of Section 2 of this Agreement. If you do not reimburse
{$servicename} for the renewal during the Renewal Grace Period your
domain name will be placed on Hold and flagged for deletion after which
you will have a 30 day redemption period during which you may pay
{$servicename} a Redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The
Redemption fee is currently $80 USD and is subject to change under the
terms of Section 2 of this agreement. If you do not redeem your domain
name prior to the end of the 30 day redemption period {$servicename}
may, at its sole discretion, delete your domain name or transfer it to
another registrant on your behalf. <br>
<br>
If your domain is deleted, the Registry also provides a 30 day
Redemption Grace Period during which you may pay {$servicename} a
redemption fee and redeem your domain name. The redemption fee is
currently $80 USD and is subject to change under the terms of Section 2
of this agreement. If you do not redeem your domain name prior to the
end of the Registry’s Redemption Grace Period the Registry will release
your name and it will become available for registration on a
first-come-first-served basis. <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>1.2. term of agreement; modifications</h3> The term of this agreement shall
continue in full force and effect as long as You have any domain name
registered through {$servicename}. You agree that You will not transfer
any domain name registered through {$servicename} to another domain name
registrar during the first sixty (60) days from its initial registration
date. You further agree that {$servicename} may charge You a small fee
if You cancel Your domain within the five (5) day grace period after
registering Your domain with {$servicename} and {$servicename} refunds
the price of Your domain. {$servicename} will not charge You a fee if
{$servicename} cancels Your domain name during this period because of
fraud. Provided, however, the five (5) day grace period does not apply
to Premium Domains, which are non-refundable. <br>
<br>
You agree that {$servicename} may modify this agreement from time to
time. {$servicename} may also discontinue services it provides under
this agreement. You agree to be bound by any changes {$servicename} may
reasonably make to this agreement when such changes become effective.
Should You elect to cancel Your agreement with {$servicename} You will
not receive a refund for any fees You may have paid to {$servicename}. <br>
<br>
You agree that {$servicename} shall not be bound by any representations
made by third parties who You may use to purchase services from

provide {$servicename} with accurate and reliable information on an
initial and continual basis, shall be considered to be a material breach
of this agreement. Failure by You, for whatever reason, to respond
within five (5) business days to any inquiries made by {$servicename} to
determine the validity of information provided by You, shall also be
considered to be a material breach of this agreement. You agree to
retain a copy for Your record of the receipt for purchase of Your domain
name. <br>

this contact information, in whole or in part, be shared with the
registry operator. As required by ICANN, this information must also be
made publicly available by means of Whois, and that the registry
operator may also be required to make this information publicly
available by Whois. Both {$servicename} and the registry operator may be
required to archive this information with a third party escrow service.
You hereby consent and give permission for all such requirements and
disclosures. Further, You represent and warrant that, if You are

possible uses of their personal information pursuant to ICANN policy.

Restrictions will be enforced directly by or through Registry Operator.
