[subject]Whois data reminder[/subject]
Dear {if $Client->Name}{$Client->Name}{else}Valued Customer{/if},

ICANN, the organization responsible for the stability of the Internet,
requires that each domain name registrant be given the opportunity to
correct any inaccurate contact data (WHOIS data) associated with a domain
name registration. Our records for your domain are as follows:

{$whois}

To review and update your WHOIS contact information, please log into
your client conrol panel at: {$registrant_cp_url}
If any of the information above is inaccurate, you should correct it.
If all of the information above is accurate, you do not need to take any action.
Please remember that under the terms of your registration agreement,
the provision of false WHOIS information can be grounds for cancellation
of your domain name registration.

If you have any questions or comments regarding ICANN's policy, please contact
them directly at questions@icann.org.

Regards, {$servicename} Staff
