OVERVIEW

EPP-DRS (EPP Domain Registration System) is the most powerful domain selling and management system in the world.
It allows you to run your own full-cycle domain registration service, with ability for your clients to register, renew, transfer domain names.

System web interface consists of 3 areas: Domain Order Wizard, Registrant Control Panel and Registrar Control Panel.
The system communicates with various registries and SRS via modules and is handling over 150 (and counting) domain extensions.

Well-docummented SDK allows developers to easily build and test custom modules.

Software is made by registrars for registrars - it's a result of collaboration with respected domain business insiders.
